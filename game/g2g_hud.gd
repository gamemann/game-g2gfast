##
## Composed from [DotTimerHud] rather than replacing it. What this adds is the genre's
## conventions: speed in genre units, a key display (the thing every bhop stream has
## in the corner), the stage, and PRACTICE the moment a checkpoint is used.

## client that stopped drawing. The chat box and the console are the presentation
## layer's, above this HUD altogether, so a blinded runner can still ask why.

## [method G2GNetBridge.in_transit]). What a player saw instead was the engine's clear
## colour with a live HUD on it — a grey screen that looked like a game that had broken —
## for as long as the map took to download and build. The chat box is the presentation
## layer's and stays above this, so the wait can still be talked through.
