## [b]Every decision in this file is downstream of one sentence: a player who came to run
## must not be stopped by anything added for a player who came to do something else.[/b]
## That is this game's own rule and it settles what would otherwise be arguments:
##
## - **Camera shake defaults to zero here, and to one everywhere else.** A surf ramp is a
##   precision input at 20 m/s; shaking the camera for a landing is not atmosphere, it is
##   taking the run away. It is still a setting, because a player doing deathmatch on the
##   same server may want it.
## - **The flash is off by default** for the same reason and with the same switch.
## - **Nothing on the fx budget is allowed to matter.** An effect never changes the
##   simulation, so a frame budget dropping one cannot change a time — which is the
##   property that makes the whole addon safe on a timer server.
##
## The one thing audio genuinely adds here is **the landing**: a bunny-hop is a rhythm,
## and a rhythm you can only see is one you have to watch your feet for.

## Plays the timer's start, splits and finish for one player.
##
## [b]The four sounds that ARE the game were reachable from the suite and from nothing
## else.[/b] `on_run_started`, `on_split` and `on_run_finished` were written, tested with
## a null sink, and never called by the client — so a run started, split and finished in
## silence on every build. Listened for on the client's OWN [DotTimerManager], which is
## fed on a netted client too (`G2GGame.tick_timers_only`), so the start is heard on the
## tick the local prediction crosses the line rather than a round trip later.
##
## A personal best is [signal DotTimerManager.record_accepted], which only fires where
## records are filed — offline, here. A netted client is told a rank, not whether it beat
## its own time, and plays the finish without the fanfare rather than guessing.
##
## Called again whenever the followed player changes; connects once per manager.
