## Climbing a ladder the way the competitive shooters do it, on the ladder volumes an
## imported map carries (world brushes with ladder contents; see `tools/bsp_mechanics.py`).
##
## [b]What a ladder is in those games:[/b] a thin invisible brush against a wall. A player
## whose hull touches it, and who is pushing into it or is off the ground, is ON it: no
## gravity, forward climbs toward where they are looking (look up and press forward to go
## up, look down to go down), strafe moves along the wall, jump lets go and pushes off it.
## Speed is the climb speed, 200 units a second, whatever the run speed is.
##
## Data, not an area, for [DotFpsSwimMode]'s reason: a box list gives a client replaying
## prediction the same answer the server had. [method update] is the game's once-a-tick
## call that puts a player on; [method _simulate] takes them off.
##
## Not in dot-player-controller, deliberately: this game is delivered as a pack, so it
## names no new class there, and a ladder the way this genre climbs one is this genre's.
