## Every key this client reads, as one table: the action, the setting that stores it, the
## words a player sees, the default, and the card it goes on.
##
## [b]Data, because four things read it and they must never disagree.[/b] The client matches
## events against the actions, the settings schema declares one binding per row, the menu's
## Controls page draws a key button per row, and the help screen (H) lists what each key
## does. Before this the keys were a `match` on keycodes in `G2GClient` and a sentence in its
## doc comment, and the sentence had already drifted once — the README said Shift for duck
## for as long as the dead `[input]` block did.
##
## [b]dot-menu's `DotMenuBindings` does the work[/b] (2026-10-09): applying a row, the
## fallback to the default, the swap when a key is taken, the reset. This file is the rows.
##
## [b]The movement actions are dot-player-controller's own names.[/b] `DotFpsSampler` polls
## `dot_fps_*` and `register_default_actions` only creates what is missing, so a binding
## applied here first is the one it reads — there is no second copy of the movement keys.
##
## [b]Stored per DEVICE, except chat.[/b] A key is a fact about a keyboard. The two chat keys
## were ACCOUNT scope before this table existed and keep it, because changing a stored
## setting's scope would quietly reset somebody's chosen key.
##
## [b]Tab is the scoreboard, held[/b], as in every game in the genre and every game in this
## family. It was "next style" until 2026-10-09; that moved to N, and schema 3's migration
## drops a stored "Tab" for it so nobody is left with two actions on one key. Escape is in
## no row and cannot be bound: it is the menu, and how a browser releases the pointer.
