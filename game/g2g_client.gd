## A playable g2gfast: one local player, a camera, a HUD, and the keys.
##
## Separate from [G2GGame], which is the simulation and runs headless. A dedicated
## server never loads this.
##
## Keys: whatever [G2GBindings] says, as the player has bound them — WASD, space (hold, if
## the server allows auto-bhop), Ctrl to duck, Tab to cycle style, M for the next map
## (offline), R to restart, C / V for practice checkpoints, F for the flashlight, O to hide
## everybody else, F5 for first and third person, H for help. Escape opens the menu and
## frees the mouse; a click, or Resume, takes it back — which is also how a browser player
## captures it in the first place, because pointer lock needs a real user gesture. See
## [method _grab_mouse].
