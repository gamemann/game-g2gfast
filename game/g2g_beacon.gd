## What an administrator's `beacon` looks like: a ring on the floor under a runner that
## sends out a ripple once a second, and a thin column above them that shows through walls.
##
## [b]Drawn on every client, from one replicated flag.[/b] The server decides who is
## beaconed (`G2GPlayer.beacon`, carried as `G2GPlayerNet.net_beacon`) and nothing about
## the picture travels: the ripple's phase is each client's own, because two screens a
## quarter of a second apart in a ripple is not something anybody can see, and sending a
## phase would be a message a second per beaconed runner for nothing.
##
## [b]Through walls, on purpose.[/b] A beacon exists so that everybody can find somebody —
## the runner an admin wants the server to watch, the one hiding in a corner of a surf map
## instead of running it — and a marker the map can hide is a marker that fails in exactly
## the spot it is used for. So the column is drawn with no depth test. The ring is not: it
## is on the floor, and on a bhop map whose blocks are stacked a ring showing through the
## block below would put the runner on a platform they are not on.
##
## [b]No column on your own beacon.[/b] A first-person camera stands inside it, and a
## no-depth-test cylinder seen from inside is a translucent smear over the whole screen —
## on a timer server, over a run. The beaconed runner still sees the ring at their feet and
## hears the ping, which is how they know.
##
## Top level, so it is placed where the runner is DRAWN rather than inheriting the body's
## per-tick transform: the local player's body steps at the tick rate and is drawn between
## ticks (Decision 10), and a ring that stepped under a smoothly moving camera would judder.
##
## Sized to this game's hull rather than copied from game-arena's: a runner here is 32
## units across, 0.61 m, and a ring as wide as the arena's would read as a mark on the
## floor beside them rather than under them.

## Seconds between ripples, and between pings.

## How far a ripple spreads before it has faded, as a multiple of the ring.

## than as part of the course on any of the maps.
