## What a networked g2gfast player replicates: the movement state, and an
## administrator's two marks on the player — `blind` and `beacon`.
##
## The timer is not replicated per tick. A client runs its own [DotTimer] over its own
## copy of the zones and reaches the same answer a tick earlier than any packet could,
## which is the whole reason the timer is deterministic; the server sends run
## identities and finishes as reliable events instead. See [DotTimerNet].
