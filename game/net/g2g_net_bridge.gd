# --- Map changes -------------------------------------------------------------
#
# dot-map's protocol, carried over dot-net: announce -> (fetch) -> ready -> load, with
# the straggler timeout and the trust refusals as dot-map wrote them. The host sends a
# MAP event per peer; a peer answers with an Ask.MAP request. dot-map is transport-
# agnostic on purpose and names no dot-net class, so this is where the two meet.
#
# [b]What it replaced[/b] was a map id broadcast from `map_ready`: sent AFTER the server
# had already swapped, to clients that had never been asked whether they had the map,
# which resolved it against their own build and fetched nothing. A client that could not
# load it stayed on the old world while the server simulated it on the new one, and
# nothing on either end knew.
#
# [b]Nothing here works around dot-map any more.[/b] Running this for the first time
# found five things wrong in the addon, and this section carried a workaround for four of
# them: it answered a joiner's ready with a `load` itself, held a joiner mid-change back
# until the change settled, thinned progress to four a second, and fetched a delivered
# map by its own convention before dot-map saw the announce — then queued every map
# message behind that fetch, because a straggler's `load` overtook it. All of that is
# dot-map's now (see its CLAUDE.md, "What the first transport found"), and what is left
# is the one decision that IS this game's:
#
# - [b]The imported-map scene is a trusted template.[/b] Every imported map is ONE scene
#   in the build pointed at a manifest (see G2GMapCatalogue) — the mount constraint
#   forbids putting it in the pack — so the client lists that scene in
#   `trusted_template_scenes`, and dot-map then requires the manifest, not the scene, to
#   be inside `res://dot_cloud/<content>/<version>/`. A server marks a map it fetched
#   into a mount as that content (`G2GGame._mark_delivered`); the client fetches it from
#   ITS OWN content client and origin, verified against ITS keys. The host still says
#   only WHICH map; this client decides what it is made of.

## The game outlives this bridge — a module unloads and the game it drove stays in the
## scene — so the host half is taken back from it here, and the next `change_map` is this
## process's own again. A FREED host already reads as null on 4.7.2 (`dedicated`'s unload
## section was armed against this and did not fire); this is for a bridge removed from the
