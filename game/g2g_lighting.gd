## This game's lighting, which is [DotLightRig] and one decision of its own.
##
## [b]It used to be the implementation and is now the caller.[/b] Reading a map's own sun,
## ambient, fog and sky out of a manifest and turning them into an [Environment] is not a
## thing about a bhop timer — it is a thing about any game that loads a world somebody else
## authored — so it is dot-lighting now, with its own suite, and what stays here is the
## part that is genuinely this game's: which profile a machine gets.
##
## See Decision 13 in this project's CLAUDE.md for what the lighting block is and where it
## comes from.

## The sky-top colour a map should have instead of its ambient, or transparent when its
## ambient is usable.
##
## [b]Four maps had a white sky.[/b] dot-lighting takes the top of the procedural sky from
## the map's `_ambient`, which in Source is the colour the sky lit the map with. A mapper who
## never set it compiles with the editor's default `255 255 255`, and surf_beginner2, bhop_aztec,
## bhop_mario_fxd and bhop_evolve are drawn under a blank white dome. That white is not a
## statement about the sky, so here the sky is looked up by its name instead (the name is
## in the file; the texture set is another game's and is not). Only the sky changes: the
## rest of the environment keeps the map's ambient as it stands.

## [b]Shadows off in a browser and glow kept, which is dot-lighting's `web()` and is doubly
## right here.[/b] A surf map is a large open volume — a shadow pass costs what is in frame
## and on a canyon that is the canyon — while the glow is what makes a neon strip read as a
## light, and a neon strip is how one of these maps signposts the route. Dropping the thing
## a player navigates by to save a cost they cannot see would be the wrong trade even if
## the two cost the same.
