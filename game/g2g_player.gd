## One player: the movement, the rig they are drawn as, the camera they look through,
## and their timer.
##
## [b]The bridge between the addons, which is where the bugs are.[/b] What this file
## alone knows:
##
## - the timer is ticked from the movement loop, after the move, with the position the
##   move produced;
## - a style has two halves and they are applied together;
## - the rig is drawn from the state — crouch, yaw — and never the other way round;
## - a camera mode is cosmetic: the controller aims from the eye whichever is active.
##
## Positions are metres by the time they reach here. Everything genre-unit-shaped
## was converted in [G2GMovement].

# --- Drawing ---------------------------------------------------------------

## Draws the state. Per frame, from the client, never from the tick.
##
## [b]The player we drive is drawn BETWEEN ticks, not on them.[/b] The simulation
## steps at [code]sv_tickrate[/code] and the screen does not, so drawing
## [code]controller.state[/code] directly quantises every motion — the camera, the
## eye, the body — to the tick rate. At the browser's 60 frames against a 128-tick
## server that is 2.133 ticks a frame: six frames advance two ticks and the seventh
## advances three, so the view moves 74 mm, 74, 74, 74, 74, 74, 112 and starts over,
## eight times a second. Measured, not reasoned about — see
## [code]examples/jitter_probe.tscn[/code]. It is the whole of the "it is very
## jittery in the browser" report, and it is why the run felt wrong while every
## number on the HUD was right.
##
## [method DotFpsController.render_state] is the cure and has been there since the
## controller was written; nothing called it. See its own note for the second half of
## why — it refused every drive but the one no networked game uses.
##
## Only for a player this machine simulates. A remote player's position arrives
## already interpolated by [DotNetInterpolator] through
## [code]G2GPlayerNet._net_interpolated[/code], and its controller has no second tick
## to blend from: [member has_camera] is the local player in both the offline and the
## networked case, which is exactly the set that is simulated here.
