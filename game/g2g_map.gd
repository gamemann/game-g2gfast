## Base class for the maps this build ships.
##
## A map builds its geometry and its zones from the same constants, so a start line
## cannot drift from the block it sits on; the written-out JSON copy in `maps/` is what
## a DELIVERED map would ship, and the headless suite checks the two agree. See
## game-playground's CLAUDE.md for the reasoning; it is the same here.
##
## Positions and sizes are in genre units throughout. Zone volumes are converted to
## metres where they are built, because the timer works in whatever the movement
## works in — and the movement works in metres.

## Where players appear if the map has no spawn zone, in units.
@export var fallback_spawn_units: Vector3 = Vector3(0.0, 8.0, 0.0)

## Tier, 1..10, for the ranking points.

## A line of bodies a player is meant to jump along, in order, and which reach it is
## meant to be jumped with. See [G2GReach] for the two, and [method add_course].

## Declares that [param bodies] are jumped in order on [param track], with the reach
## [param kind] ([code]G2GReach.Kind.RUN[/code] or [code].CHAIN[/code]).
##
## [b]The only hand-written part is which bodies are a route and which reach it is
## sized for.[/b] The rise, the gap and the landing room are read off the bodies'
## transforms and shapes by [G2GReach], so moving a block moves the route and
## `headless_run` re-decides it — game-arena's `climbs` pattern, for a genre with two
## reaches rather than one. A map is content and content does not assert; the question
## is asked in the suite, where failing is useful.
