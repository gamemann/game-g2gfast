## How far the movement carries a player, asked of the tunables a player actually runs
## with — and every jump a hand-written map asks for, measured against it.
##
## [b]Two reaches, because this genre has two and a gap is sized for one of them.[/b]
##
## [b]RUN[/b] is a jump taken at the lip from the ground at run speed. Ground
## acceleration puts a player back at [code]max_speed[/code] in about thirty units, so a
## player who lands anywhere on a block can always run to its edge and take this jump,
## however badly the last one went. It is what a player who cannot chain has, and what
## `headless_run`'s needle bot does. Under the shipped cvars it clears 189 units flat.
##
## [b]CHAIN[/b] is a hop inside a run of auto-hops at course speed, and it is a different
## quantity rather than a longer one. A chained hop takes off wherever the last one
## LANDED, not at the lip — with the key held there is no grounded tick to walk to the
## edge on — so across a line of blocks the hops have to average one whole block period
## (the gap plus the block), and a hop that falls short of the period spends the run-out
## the last landing left. Carrying speed is what makes a period possible, and strafing is
## the only thing that makes speed; so whether a chain is inside reach is a question
## about how much a player can gain in the air, which [method hop] answers from the
## tunables' own air cap.
##
## [b]A CHAIN verdict is an upper bound, deliberately.[/b] [method hop] assumes a PERFECT
## strafe every tick, which no person manages, so a chain it refuses is one nobody can
## run, and a chain it accepts is only possible. How much of a perfect strafe a chain
## needs ([method strafe_needed]) is the number that says how HARD it is, and it is
## printed rather than asserted: the suite fails on impossible, and a person reads the
## rest.
##
## [b]No hull credit anywhere.[/b] The capsule can stand with its centre a little past a
## lip, and on this game's 45.57° slope limit that is about eleven units a side. None of
## that is spent here — every distance is the player's centre from lip to lip — so it is
## the margin, rather than a factor somebody picked.
##
## Everything here is in genre units, read out of [DotFpsTunables] through [G2GUnits]:
## the jump, the gravity, the run speed, the air cap and the landing cap are the server's
## own, so `sv_gravity 600` or `sv_enablebunnyhopping 0` changes every answer below with
## no second copy of any number to update. That is the difference from the two games
## that asked this before (`[reach-1]`), which carry their three constants beside the
## maps with a check that they agree.
