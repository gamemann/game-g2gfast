## [b]The check that matters is the negative one.[/b] Discovery finding three maps
## proves nothing on its own — a hardcoded list of three finds three too. What says
## there is no list is that a map the catalogue holds and the disk does not is
## *removed*, and one the disk holds and the catalogue does not is *added*, without
## anybody naming either.

## Checks that do not depend on how many maps are on disk. `_test_zones_have_floor`
## adds one per hand-written map and `_test_maps_are_surveyed` six, which is a number
## this file deliberately does not write down -- see [method _test_zones_have_floor].

## Hand-written maps whose survey finds a tilted slab a player can STAND on, and how

## entry goes stale the day the slab is fixed rather than excusing the next one.
##
## `bhop_g2g_stages`' surf bonus is two 45° slabs, and this game's slope limit is
## 45.57°: a player stands on both, so the bonus is a walk down a pair of steep floors
## rather than surf. It is a scored track and reshaping it is Christian's call, not a
