## The one bug in this file's history that no assertion in it could have caught, and
## the reason it is now an assertion.
##
## [G2GRig] puts a player's body on two visibility layers so the OWNER'S first-person
## camera can cull it while every other camera still draws it — that is what
## [member G2GCamera.first]'s cull mask is for, and the third-person path depends on
## the same two layers. It set both layers unconditionally, so the culled layer was
## never the only one and the first-person camera drew its own player's avatar at
## point-blank range. The bottom third of the screen was the inside of the player's
## own head, in every frame, on every map.
##
## Every number in the game was right: the cull mask, the layer constant, the
## third-person view, and the `visible_to_owner` flag, which arrived correctly and was
## then used for nothing. It was found in a screen recording, which is where an
## interface bug is always found. What it costs to check here is one bitwise AND.
