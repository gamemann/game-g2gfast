## `surf_g2g_intro` — two ramps meeting in a valley, descending, with three bonuses.
##
## Surf ramps are built at angles a player cannot stand on — the standable
## limit is a normal of 0.7, about 45.6° — and this one is 60°. The player drops off
## the start platform onto a face too steep to stand on, slides under gravity, and
## strafes to keep and gain speed. The seam between the two ramps is the geometry
## dot-player-controller's crease resolution exists for.
##
## Everything in genre units. The valley falls 3072 units over 8192.
##
## [b]The ramps above are level along their length and the descent is the floor's.[/b]
## That is measured rather than suspected — `headless_run` prints how much of the route
## a bot actually rides — and `the fall line`, bonus 3, is the route on this map where
## the answer is the ramp. See the constants below it.
##
## [b]It declares no course (`G2GMap.add_course`), and that is an answer rather than an
## omission.[/b] Every way from one surface to the next here is a drop onto something
## below — a pad onto a bank, a bank onto a bank, a bank's end onto a finish — and the
## question a drop asks is whether the thing below is there, which only riding it
## answers. `headless_run` drives a bot down all four, and two of them to the finish.

# --- Bonus 3: the fall line ------------------------------------------------
#
# [b]The route where the descent comes from the ramp.[/b] Every other surface on this
# map that is called a ramp is banked about the run axis and LEVEL along its length —
# `G2GGeometry.ramp` rotates about `Vector3.FORWARD`, which tilts a slab in X and Y and
# leaves its Z extent horizontal — so a player riding one is carried sideways into the
# valley and every metre they descend afterwards comes from the stepped floor. Driving
# it says so: a bot on the main track rides under 5% of a 156 m route, crosses neither
# split, and the 636 u/s the suite reads as "surf speed" is what falling into the pit is
# worth. See `[surf-ramp-1]`.
#
# This route is the same two banked faces PITCHED downhill, so the fall line runs along
# the route instead of across it. The bank is unchanged at 60° and still past anything a
# player can stand on, which is what makes it surf rather than a slide; the pitch is what
# makes the ramp, rather than the floor under it, the thing that makes a player fast.
#
# [b]It is a pitched BED with a bank either side, and it was a V first.[/b] The first
# draft made the whole route out of two banked faces meeting in a crease, on the theory
# that a V self-centres and is therefore drivable by a bot that cannot air-strafe. It
# does self-centre, and it is not surf: two faces banked the same amount opposite ways
# resolve to a normal pointing straight UP, so the crease of a V built out of two
# surfaces nobody can stand on is a surface everybody can stand on. Driven, the bot
# rode 18 m, came to rest in the crease and sat there for the remaining 1,200 ticks.
#
# So the thing carrying the player is a single face pitched past the standable limit,
# the way `the plunge` is in game-playground — the bot holds forward and nothing else —
# and the two 60° banks are at the EDGES, where a drifting player is thrown back to the
# middle instead of off the route. That is the arrangement a surf map's own tube
# sections use, and it is the one that survives being driven.
