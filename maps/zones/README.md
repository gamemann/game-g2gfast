# What a map does not say about itself

One file per map, named for its id, merged into the manifest by `tools/bsp_import.py`.

**Coordinates in here are Hammer's**, the ones the tools in `tools/` print — the axis swap and the yaw conversion happen once, in the importer, where every other coordinate's does. A file that mixed the two would be a file nobody can check against the map it describes.

Six of the eighteen maps beside this directory label their own zones on the trigger volumes: `zone_start`, `map_end_zone`, `startzone_s4`, `tm_bonus2_endzone`, `start_trigger`, `end_trigger`. Those are read straight out of the entity lump by `zone_role()` and need nothing here. This directory is for the rest, and for the halves the labelled ones are missing — and every entry says **why**, because a finish line is a judgement about a map somebody played, and the next person to look at it deserves the evidence rather than a number.

**The commonest thing a bhop map labels is a destination, not a volume.** Seven of the ten imported in the second pass name their start or their finish on an `info_teleport_destination` — `finish`, `end`, `START`, `Stage1` — which is a point rather than a volume and so is invisible to `zone_role()`, which reads targetnames off `trigger_multiple` and `trigger_once`. `"teleport_to"` is the rule that turns one back into a volume: the trigger aimed at the destination is the line, and `"max_horizontal"` separates the door-sized one from the room-sized pit that is usually aimed at the same place. That is how `bhop_mario_fxd`, `bhop_badges`, `bhop_monster_jam`, `bhop_arcane_v2`, `bhop_fur` and `bhop_aztec` are timed here.

**Two of the eighteen still have no finish, and neither is a mistake.** `buses_from_hell_fixed` is not a course at all — no teleports, no destinations, eight `func_rotating` and a `game_ui`, which is a vehicle map. `bhop_lego2` is a section-chain map (`s_1`..`s_30`) whose sections are all labelled and whose end is not: nothing in the file distinguishes the last gate from the ones before it. (`bhop_eazy` was the other until 2026-10-08: its last gate turned out to be the only arrival nothing leads back from, a hub of menu teleports, and its file says so.) Both load, draw and collide; a run on them wants zones drawn in-game, which is what the zone editor (Z) and the console are for. Guessing here would produce a board that looks right and measures a route the map does not have. A fourth arrived with gb-maps-1: `surf_grave_reloaded` is a combat surf map — weapon stashes behind doors in both spawn rooms, a bomb target, and every teleport aimed back at a spawn, the prison or the cliff top — so it is a loop to fight on and its file is credit only, on purpose. Since 2026-10-08 it and the other combat surf maps say `"kind": "arena"`, which keeps them installed and loadable but out of g2gfast's rotation and vote, and marks them for game-arena.

## What a zone may say

A volume, exactly one of:

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `"box": [[x,y,z],[x,y,z]]` | two corners, Hammer coordinates |
| `"named": "targetname"` | the brush volume of the entity(ies) with that name |
| `"teleport_to": "dest"` | the `trigger_teleport` aimed at that destination (`"all": true` to union them) |
| `"around": {"point": …, "extents": [x,y,z]}` | a box grown around a destination name, a list of them, or a literal point |
| `"near": {"class": "trigger_multiple", "point": [x,y,z], "within": 512}` | the nearest brush entity of that class |

Plus `"kind"`, `"track"`, `"number"` (a stage), `"destination"` (a name or a point), `"destination_yaw"`, and `"note"`.

A `STAGE` with a `"number"` and a `"destination"` and **no volume rule** does not add a stage: it moves where `!s<n>` puts a player on the stage the map already labelled, and stops the import if there is no such stage. The line stays the mapper's. `surf_summit`'s stage 3 is the one use: the floor of its checkpoint gate is the edge of its fail plane.

**Which track a pit is on comes from the map, not from this file.** Every `trigger_teleport` left over after the zones is a `RESPAWN`, on the track whose `START` volume its destination is inside (within 64 units), copied to each if several, and on the main track otherwise (`pit_tracks` in `tools/bsp_import.py`). A fail teleport sends a player back to the start of the route they fell off, so this is the mapper's own statement of whose pit it is. And a pit's box is cut back off any arrival that is inside the box but outside the brush (`trim_to_hull`), because the box around a wedge-shaped pit reaches over the ramp it sits under.

`"doorways": {"max_horizontal": 512}` opts a map into the rule that a teleport volume narrower than that is a **door the player walks through** rather than the pit — `TELEPORT`, which keeps the run, rather than `RESPAWN`, which ends it. It is not on by default because it is only true of a map whose sections are joined by doors.

`"remove": [{"box": [[x, y, z], [x, y, z]], "note": "..."}]` cuts world geometry out of the import, in Hammer units: every world brush whose whole hull is inside a box, and every world face that belongs only to those brushes (judged by its centre, so a floor under a removed wall stays drawn). It goes from collision, drawing, water, ladders and clips at once, because it is applied to the `.bsp` before any of them read it; brush entities (pushes, teleports, doors) are untouched. The lightmap is the map's own, so the floor keeps the removed geometry's baked shadow. surf_year3000 uses it for the middle building whose sealed void the spawn stood in. Say why in `note`: this changes the mapper's map, and it is the only key here that does.

`"skybox": false` leaves the map's 3D skybox out. By default it is drawn as the engine draws it -- its faces and props `scale` times their compiled size about the `sky_camera` -- which is what surrounds ten of these maps with their mountains and cities. Turn it off only against a reference frame that shows the map without it, and say which in `"skybox_why"`; its miniature is never drawn where it was compiled either way.

Anything a rule cannot resolve is an error and stops the import. That is deliberate: a finish line that silently resolved to nothing is a map that cannot be finished, and nothing about playing it would say so.

## Filters, doors and credit

`"conditional_teleports": {"filters": ["name"], "note": "..."}` drops the `trigger_teleport`s behind those filters as zones. Where the map gives that name with a delay (an anti-standing trap: `AddOutput targetname activator` 0.09 s after touching a block), each dropped teleport becomes a per-player sinking block with that delay instead (`bsp_mechanics.trap_blocks`, since 2026-10-08). A name is the filter entity's `targetname` (what the teleport's `filtername` holds) or the activator name it passes. Use it for a trap whose name the map sets and then resets — the anti-standing block — and never for a checkpoint pit, whose name stays set and which is a real pit. A listed name that matches no teleport stops the import. Teleports behind a class filter no player passes are dropped without being asked.

`"round_teleports": {"names": ["youlose*", "timesup*"], "note": "..."}` drops `trigger_teleport`s that start disabled, by targetname (`fnmatch` patterns). A race surf map runs a round: reaching the end enables a `youlose<n>` teleport to the jail over every section, a timer enables `timesup<n>` ones later, and buttons enable level-select pads. This importer runs none of a map's outputs, so each of those imported as a pit that sent a runner to a jail or another level the moment they entered it. Opt-in and by name, because some held maps were zoned against the old behaviour and a start-disabled teleport can also be a section's way on; only a teleport that really starts disabled is ever dropped, and a pattern that drops nothing stops the import. `surf_omnibus`, `surf_lore`, `surf_eclipse` and `bhop_exodus` use it.

`"sky_walls": {"nearest": "grids/", "note": "..."}` draws the map's world `tools/toolsskybox` faces as walls, each in the material of the nearest drawn face whose name starts with that prefix. A sky face is opaque in the source engine -- nothing behind it is ever drawn -- and skipped here it is a window onto the rest of the map, which is what surf_kitsune's section end walls were. Use it only where the sky faces are walls a player looks at; on most maps they are the open sky. Faces inside the 3D skybox's room are never drawn this way.

`"attribution": {"author": ..., "source": ..., "archive": ..., "recorded": ...}` is who made the map and where that was read. **It is required:** `tools/bsp_import.py` refuses a map whose file has no attribution, or one with an empty `author`, `source` or `recorded`, the same way a listed filter name that matches nothing stops the import. These maps are other people's work, and that refusal is what stops the next one arriving uncredited. Every map here carries one since 2026-09-27; the `source` says what confirmed the author (the download page, and whether something inside the map agreed), and where the page alone did. A map whose file you are writing for the first time needs only `id`, `author` and `attribution` to import; everything else is optional. `tools/import_maps.sh` re-imports a map whose zones file is newer than its import, so a new credit reaches the manifest without `--force`.

## Kind

`"kind"` is copied into the manifest and becomes the map's `DotMapDef.kind`. Left out, the id's prefix decides (`bhop_`, `surf_`). **`"arena"` marks a combat map** -- small, built to fight on rather than to time: buyzones or weapon buttons, jails, every teleport back to a spawn. g2gfast keeps such a map installed and loadable with `map <id>`, lists it on M as combat, and leaves it out of the rotation, the vote and nominations unless `cfg/map_rotation.yml` names it. Say why in `"kind_why"`.
