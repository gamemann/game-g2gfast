## `bhop_g2g_intro` — sixteen blocks with widening gaps, three stages, and four bonuses.
##
## Built in genre units so it reads like a brush list. The gaps grow from 96
## to 288 units: at 250 u/s a standing jump clears about 190, so from the tenth block
## on the only way across is to have kept the speed from the earlier ones — which
## means landing and jumping on the same tick, every time, which is the whole skill.
## With [code]sv_autobunnyhopping 1[/code] that is holding the key and aiming; with it
## off, it is the tick.
##
## The bonus is a short side route off the start pad: three wide platforms and a
## finish, for a player who wants a warm-up.
##
## [b]Bonus 2 is the other half of that, and it is a different skill rather than a
## harder version of the same one.[/b] The main route and bonus 1 are both about SPEED:
## the gap grows until only a player who kept the last block's momentum can cross it.
## `the needle` keeps its gap at 96 units the whole way down — the shortest gap on the
## map, and well inside a standing jump at run speed, so no hop on it is ever about
## carrying speed — and narrows the landing instead, 192 units wide down to 48. A block
## 48 units across is 16 units wider than the player, and the whole of it is aim.
##
## Two reasons that shape rather than a longer gap. A player who cannot yet chain hops
## has nothing to practise on this map, because everything else on it refuses them at
## the tenth block; the needle refuses nobody for lack of speed and is still hard. And a
## constant gap is the one shape a SCRIPTED bot can complete — it cannot strafe, so it
## cannot gain, so a route that demands a gain is a route no check can ever drive end to
## end. `headless_run` drives this one from its start line to its finish through both of
## its stage splits, which nothing in this repository could do on a bonus before.
##
## [b]96 rather than 160, and the difference was measured rather than chosen.[/b] At 160
## a hopping bot cleared seven blocks and fell at the eighth: a chained hop takes off
## wherever the last one landed rather than at the lip, so the distance actually
## available is the jump MINUS however far onto the block the bot arrived, and that
## margin bleeds a little every landing. A gap a standing jump clears is not the same
## as a gap a chain of them clears, which is the number this map's main route encodes in
## its first block and nowhere says out loud.
##
## [b]Bonus 3, `the hairpin`, is the one route here that turns.[/b] See
## [constant HAIRPIN_LEGS].
##
## [b]Bonus 4, `the stutter`, is the one whose blocks are not all one length.[/b] See
## [constant STUTTER_BLOCKS].

## Bonus 3, `the hairpin`: out, across and back, a U of RUN jumps east of the warm-up.
##
## [b]Every other route on this map is a straight line down -Z.[/b] The hairpin asks for
## the one thing none of them does: land, turn, and leave in a new direction. It goes
## out along -Z, turns right on a square corner block onto a climbing traverse along +X,
## turns right again on a second corner at the top, and comes back along +Z down a stair
## of drops onto blocks that narrow from 160 to 96, finishing beside where it started.
## The two corners are the two stage lines (drawn in the finish colour, as `the ridge`'s
## are), and each faces the direction the route LEAVES it in, which is the direction a
## restarting player has to go.
##
## [b]Every gap is a RUN gap, sized with [G2GReach] under the shipped cvars[/b] — 189
## flat, 166 onto +24, 222 down 48 — and each is at least 29 units inside it, so a
## player who lands anywhere can run to the lip and take the next one. That is what a
## corner needs: a turn costs the speed a chain would be carrying, so a turning route
## sized for a CHAIN would be one only a strafer who turns in the air could run.
##
## One list, read by the geometry, the zones and `headless_run`'s bot ([method
## hairpin_blocks]). `heading` is [code]Vector2(x, z)[/code]; a leg's `turn` is the
## heading its corner leaves in, and `corner_gap` / `corner_rise` the jump onto it.

]

## Bonus 4, `the stutter`: a straight line whose RHYTHM changes, west of the needle.
##
## [b]Every other route here is a run of equal blocks[/b], so once a player has the
## period of the first hop they have the period of the whole route. The stutter's
## blocks are either 96 units long (a stone: a jump from the lip lands within about 20
## units of its far edge, so the next jump goes almost as the player lands) or 224 (a
## runway: time to land, get the speed back and line the next one up), in an order that
## never repeats long enough to settle into. Three sections: flat stones, rollers (up 24,
## down 24, up 24 ...), and stones stepping down 48 at a time with one runway among
## them. The two runways that end a section carry the stage lines and are drawn in the
## finish colour, as the ridge's and the hairpin's splits are.
##
## [b]A stone is sized FROM the reach, not inside it.[/b] A jump taken at the lip at run
## speed comes down a fixed distance on (G2GReach RUN: 189 flat, 166 onto +24, 222 down
## 48), and a stone has to contain the landing: its gap is chosen so that distance
## lands about 40 to 60 units onto a 96-unit block. A 128 gap before a stone at the same
## height, 112 before a step up, 144 before a step down 24, 160 before a drop of 48. A
## gap a player could clear easily is the wrong gap here, because it throws them off the
## far end. Every gap is still at least 30 units inside RUN, declared with add_course.
##
## One list, read by the geometry, the zones and `headless_run`'s bot ([method
## stutter_blocks]): each entry is the gap and rise INTO the block, its length and width,
## and the stage split drawn on it (0 for none).
