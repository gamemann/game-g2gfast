## A bot that follows a route written down as data, and air-strafes to keep up with it.
##
## [b]Why a route and not a heading (`g2g-maps-1`).[/b] `stage_ride` heading straight for
## the finish finished none of eight imported maps: a bhop corridor turns, and a bot
## aimed through a wall stops at the wall. The line a map is run along is not in the BSP
## anywhere -- it is in the mapper's head and in every player's -- so it is written here,
## per map, in `maps/routes/<id>.json`: a list of points in the manifest's units and axes
## (Godot axes in genre units: x, up, z -- what every tool here prints), which the bot
## passes in order before it heads for the finish.
##
## [b]It strafes.[/b] The hand-built routes' bots hold forward and never gain, because a
## route that asked for a gain could not be driven (CLAUDE.md, `the needle`). An imported
## bhop map asks for one on every section, so this one strafes: in the air it looks along
## its own velocity and holds strafe toward the side its next point is on. With this
## game's `sv_airaccelerate` the whole of `sv_maxairwishspeed` is added every tick, and
## at right angles to the velocity that is the most any wish direction adds -- so the
## same input both gains and turns, which is what a player's mouse-and-strafe-key does.
## Pointed straight at its target it alternates sides each tick and gains without turning.
##
## On a face too steep to stand on it surfs the way `stage_ride` does -- along the face,
## strafing into it -- choosing the direction along the face that its next point is in.
##
## A point is `[x, up, z]` or `{"at": [x, up, z], ...}` with any of:
##   `"radius"`  units within which (flat) the point counts as passed (default 96)
##   `"max"`     a speed (u/s) above which the bot stops strafing until under it
##   `"walk"`    true: no jumping toward this point (a narrow ledge, a drop to walk off)
##   `"hop"`     true: jump on every landing toward this point (keep speed) instead of
##               only at a lip or a step too tall to walk, which is the default
##   `"land"`    false: the point is passed in the air too. By default a point counts
##               only once the bot is on the ground near or past it -- landed on it --
##               because a block flown over is not a block reached. A surf route sets
##               it false for the whole route at the top level.
##   `"door"`    true: a door (a TELEPORT zone) to walk into; passed when it teleports
##   `"note"`    why the point is there; ignored
## A point also counts as passed once the bot is beyond it along the leg it is on, so a
## point the bot flies past at speed is not chased back.
