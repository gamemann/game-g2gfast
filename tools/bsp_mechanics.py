"""What a map's brush entities DO, as data the game can run.

`bsp_import.py` reads a map's geometry, its collision and its timer zones. This file
reads the rest of what the entity lump says about movement: where the water is, which
volumes push, which change gravity, which hurt, which floors carry you, and which blocks
sink under a player who stays on them. Each one is a list of boxes with a few numbers,
in genre units and Godot axes like everything else in the manifest, and
`game/g2g_map_mechanics.gd` is the one place that runs them.

Every brush entity Source's level editor offers is accounted for in
`docs/brush-entities.md`, with what this importer does with it and why. The short form:
the map's own logic (outputs, inputs, filters that rename the player, moving parts
driven by buttons) is not run, because this game is not a scripting engine; what a
player FEELS standing in a volume is, because a map plays wrong without it.
