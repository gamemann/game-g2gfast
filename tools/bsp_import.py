"""Turn a Source .bsp into an importable g2gfast map: mesh, textures, baked light, zones.

    tools/bsp_import.py ../inspirations/g2gfast/surf_kitsune.bsp maps/imported --id surf_kitsune

Writes into <out>/<id>/:

    <id>.bin              vertex and index data, one block per material
    <id>.json             the manifest: surfaces, materials, zones, spawns
    <id>_lightmap.png     the map's own baked lighting, packed into one atlas
    textures/*.png        every texture the .bsp carried in its pakfile

That directory IS the map. There is no scene and no script per map: every imported map
is the one `maps/imported_map.tscn` that ships inside the build, pointed at a different
manifest. A generated `<id>.tscn` cannot work for a map that arrives after the export --
`res://` is a read-only PCK in a shipped build -- so a map is data at a path, and the
paths the game searches include ones outside `res://` for exactly that reason.

[b]Why a mesh binary and not glTF.[/b] The baked lighting needs a second UV set,
and the route through glTF into Godot's importer decides for you what a second UV
set means -- it lands on `ao_texture` (greyscale, so the coloured neon that is this
map's entire character goes grey) or on `emission` (additive, so it washes out).
Building the [ArrayMesh] in [method ArrayMesh.add_surface_from_arrays] costs about
twenty lines, keeps ARRAY_TEX_UV2 as what it is, and is the shape every other map in
this repository already has: geometry made in code.

[b]Units.[/b] Positions are in genre units, Godot axes. See tools/bsp_read.py.

# flat grey mass with the ramps in it invisible.

    ordinary sRGB PNG that Godot imports with no special handling.

    `v = min(1, c * 2**e / 255)` divided by the range of the MANTISSA byte rather than
    by anything the number means, and put the median luxel at 0.03. Reinhard,
    `v / (v + key)` against the map's own median, replaced it and fixed the darkness --
    but Reinhard is a DISPLAY operator and this is not a display, it is a light term
    that still has to be multiplied by an albedo. It compresses ratios everywhere,
    including the midtones where every readable thing in a map lives.

    That was measured against a reference frame of one of these maps as its own engine
    draws it. The reference spans a linear luminance ratio of 303:1 from its darkest
    fifth-percentile pixel to its brightest ninety-fifth; the same view of our import
    spanned 7.9:1. A cave lit by one warm lamp came out as an evenly grey room. Nothing
    about the geometry, the textures or the albedo was wrong -- the light had simply had
    its contrast removed before it ever reached the shader.

    So: expose, clip, encode. Linear light is divided by the map's own
    [code]EXPOSURE_QUANTILE[/code] luxel so that the bright end lands at white, anything
    above that clips -- which the source engine also does, since its overbright range is
    finite too -- and the result is written through gamma 2.2. **Every ratio below the
    clip survives exactly**, which is the entire point: gamma encoding is already the
    compression an 8-bit image needs, and a 500:1 linear range is what sRGB was designed
    to carry. The atlas is still an ordinary sRGB PNG that Godot imports with no special
    handling, and `source_color` on the sampler undoes the gamma on the way back to
    linear, so the shader multiplies an honest light value by an honest albedo.

    vbsp writes the twin. Negating on top of that inverted the normal of every face
    with the flag -- 26% of surf_year3000, 40% of surf_beginner2.

    Measured rather than reasoned about, because the documentation for that field reads
    both ways. For 1500 faces of surf_year3000 the centroid was pushed six units each
    way and tested against every solid brush in the map: where one side was solid and
    the other was not -- 908 of them -- the plane normal pointed away from the solid
    908 times with the side flag clear and 178 times with it set, and pointed into the
    solid twice in total.

    [b]Nothing could see it until now.[/b] The normals went into ARRAY_NORMAL and the
    shader that reads them is `unshaded`, so a map lit by its own baked lightmap looks
    identical either way, and backface culling follows the winding rather than the
    normal. It is visible for the first time because the surface roles are read off the

    `textured` says which materials the pakfile actually carried. A material it did not

    the collider, and a hull crossing from one to the next meets the leading edge of
    the second: on Surf_Mesa's first ramp, which the mapper built as segments 500 units
    long, the real motor gets kicked off the face at 36 u/s at the seam and rises 1.5
    units before gravity brings it back -- a bump on a flat ramp, every half second, and
    "the ramps are a bit bumpy" (Christian's 2026-10-07 footage). Source's own trace
    walks one BSP tree and never sees the seam at all.

    So two brushes that touch on a plane -- one's side is the other's, facing the other

    corners are behind every OTHER side of the other. That is the merge test the

    so nothing a player can stand on or hit moves; only the edge between them goes.
    Repeated until nothing merges, so a ramp of twenty segments becomes one wedge.

    Bevel sides are left out of the test (vbsp adds them for its own tracing, and they
    can exclude a neighbour that the brush's real sides do not), and only brushes of
    the same contents merge, so a playerclip never swallows the solid beside it.

    are half-spaces and a point test against them is exact; a displacement is terrain,
