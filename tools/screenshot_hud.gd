## Renders this game's HUD to `screenshots/` so a person can look at it.
##
## [b]This was the only game in the family with no way to look at its own interface.[/b]
## `tools/bsp_preview.sh` renders MAPS and has since it was written; the HUD — the clock,
## the speed, the key display, the stage line, the crosshair — had nothing, and a timer
## HUD is the one surface in this repository a player stares at for an entire run. Four
## of the bugs in this family's list were found by looking at a picture, and two of them
## were a Control laid out inside nothing while every property on it read correctly.
##
## Three frames, because the states differ in the ways that go wrong:
##
## [codeblock]
## hud_run        mid-run, keys down, a stage reference to compare against
## hud_practice   the same run after a checkpoint — PRACTICE has to appear
## hud_notice     a filed time over the top, which is the widest text the HUD draws
## hud_clock      the time left as a server's vote describes it, after an extend
## hud_no_clock   a server whose vote has no clock: no time left drawn at all
## hud_beacon     an admin's beacon on another runner four metres ahead: ring, column
## hud_blind      the same view after an admin's blind: black, with the HUD still on it
## [/codeblock]
##
## [b]`--fx` renders the two gate effects instead[/b] (`tools/screenshot_hud.sh --fx`):
## `g2gfast_fx_start` and `g2gfast_fx_finish`, each drawn by the real presentation layer's
## `on_run_started` / `on_run_finished` at a point on the floor three metres in
## front of the camera, and `g2gfast_fx_both` with the two side by side. The particles are
## slowed to a tenth of real speed and captured at a fixed point in the effect's own time,
## because a software renderer under xvfb is slower than the effect and a capture on the
## Nth frame would be a different moment of it on every machine. `--debug` prints where each
## emitter's particles are at the capture, which is how the origin bug in `scenes/fx/` showed.
##
## Run through `tools/screenshot_hud.sh`. [b]Not `--headless`[/b]: that gives a null
## renderer, a 64 x 64 viewport, and every frame it saves is empty — which is worse than
## no screenshot because it looks like one.
